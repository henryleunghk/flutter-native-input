# Native Text Input for Flutter

A text input widget built using the native `UITextView` on iOS (this package only supports iOS for now).

## Installation

Follow the instructions from https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_text_input/install

## Why you should use this

Many iOS users are used to the subtle features provided by the native `UITextView` throughout iOS. Even though Flutter provides a lot of useful widgets, many Flutter developers will notice that `TextField` or `CupertinoTextField` provided by Flutter are [not on par with their native counterpart][1].

The above shows just one of the missing text editing features in Flutter's `TextField`, when comparing to the native `UITextView`. Features like these are especially important if you're building an app that involves a lot of text composition (messaging, editing document, and so on).

To address this, this package simply wraps the native `UITextView` as a Flutter widget.

Hope you find it useful and happy coding! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
